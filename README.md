## Modernize Translations

This is where people will be able to submit translations for different languages, for me to implement in Modernize. Below are the steps for submitting a translation.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open any of the plist files included.
3. Create a new text file, with each line translated and what they were translated from.
4. Example: Translation - Original.
5. Do this for each file included.
6. Create a branch with the name of the language you've translated to.
7. Push your changes to that branch, and then create a pull request.
8. I will later close the request and mark the translation as complete.
